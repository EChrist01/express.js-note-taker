- GET /notes should return the notes.html file
- GET \* should return the index.html file
  The following API routes should be created:
- GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.
- POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the requests body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look for npm package)
